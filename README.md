# AN_RFMod_CRC
An Application Note made as a college assignment. It explains what is needed to implement a  ASK radio frequency communication, from technology principles to actual hardware and software.\
Here you can find an [Application Note](link) (in portuguese) that details the hardware and software used in the protocol. There are also files such as a guide and examples to help using this application.\
Check also [this other repository](https://github.com/GabPGomes/433MHz_RF_Module_STM32F4x) with most of the code used in this application and a deeper explanation about the other functions used. The main difference between the two programs is that the AN_RFMod_CRC uses the built-in CRC calculation unit of the STM32F401RE while the other one implements CRC via software.
